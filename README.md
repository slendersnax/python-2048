# python-2048

### description
A console version of the popular 2048 game using Python (and Pygame). 
Tip: use the arrow keys to move the numbers.

#### Warning
It's very jank as this was made so I could familiarise myself with Python.
I couldn't make any Keyboard module work so in the end I just added Pygame - that's why a tiny window opens somewhere even though the game is displayed entirely in the console.
